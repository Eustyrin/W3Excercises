                 I did it! I created a shitty 90s website that 
                 <br>for some reason everyone had back in the day!
                 <br>Turns out it IS a good idea to keep
                 <br> working on the things you enjoy after all
                 <br>
                 <h1>
                    Why?

                    Well, i was about to call it for today,
                    <br>when suddenly I had the urge to not
                    <br>disappoint everyone again by abandoning 
                    <br>(hard word to type without looking)
                    <br>the thing I wanted to learn, and decided against it.
                    <br>And here we are now!
